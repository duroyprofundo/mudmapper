MUD Mapper
==========

An HTML5 canvas based tool for creating maps of MUDs and/or dungeons.

Based on the Virtual Graph Paper utility created by Garrett Bartley:
http://www.garrettbartley.com/graphpaper.html

Click on an empty square to create a room.  Click and drag between squares
to create an exit.  Use the color and label toolbar options to identify
interesting rooms/exits.

This is a preliminary version.  All feedback greatly appreciated.  Things I'd
still like to do:  
1. Mobile/touch screen support
